# Voter Participation Data Extractor for Portland, Maine

The City of Portland distributes voter participation info in PDF format. This makes it a CSV.

## Prerequisites

```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Add the city-provided PDF of voter participation data to the folder as a file titled "Voter Participation History.pdf".
2. Open a terminal and run the following command to extract data:

```shell
python3 -m voter_participation_parser
```

3. Unless there is a problem, you output will be saved as "Voter Participation History.csv".
